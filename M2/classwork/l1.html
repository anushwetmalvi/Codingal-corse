                    <p>
                        Dogs are domesticated mammals,
                         not natural
                        wild animals. They were originally
                         bred
                        from wolves. They have been bred by
                        humans for a long time, and were the
                        first animals ever to be domesticated.

                        Dogs are known for their loyalty and
                        companionship. They are often
                         referred to dogs.
